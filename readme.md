This is a fan project for predicting the English version of the game Ensemble Stars' event dates. The purpose of this project is two-fold. First, it's to help people (including myself) plan out which events to schedule their life around (yeah, I know...), and second, it's just a quick little coding project I wanted to try to throw together.

Dates in the future are *speculation* and subject to change. In no way is this a reflection of officially announced dates, aside from past events.

All future event dates are programatically generated.
