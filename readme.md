This is a fan project for predicting the English version of the game Ensemble Stars' event dates. The purpose of this project is two-fold. First, it's to help people (including myself) plan out which events to schedule their life around (yeah, I know...), and second, it's just a quick little coding project I wanted to try to throw together.

Dates in the future are *speculation* and subject to change. In no way is this a reflection of officially announced dates, aside from past events.

All future event dates are programatically generated.

Note that if image links are dead toward the bottom of the page, that's because I don't have those images yet.
