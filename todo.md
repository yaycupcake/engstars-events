# To Do List

- switch from momentjs to dayjs
- allow user to choose locale (and/or detect it, though that has its own issues)
- allow toggling (or display both) languages of event names
- make the start/end dates less ugly colors, maybe indicate with an icon or text
- overall nicer layout with like boxes or something for each event
- maybe add a list of chars who are the 5, 4, and 3 stars in the events
- better display for mobile and scaling in general (partly implemented)
- grey out or hide past events (as an option)
- general code cleanup (ongoing)
- maybe set up a placeholder image for events I don't have the banner for
- font options, actual font imports, default system font stack fallback
- add google translate option for the jp event titles
- link to readme and/or repo generally from the live site

Note: As this is a casual fan-project, these things may or may not be done. The list is also not necessarily in order or priority.
